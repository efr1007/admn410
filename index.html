	<h1> About Us </h1>
	<h2> History </h2>
	Durham House of Pets was founded in 2002 by Nick and Eliza Powers. They started out as a small store making homeade dog treats, and over the years evolved into a full pet shop, with everything from beds to toys to brushes, for all kind of animals.
	<h2> Why Use Us </h2>
	We are a small family owned business. We have lived in this town our entire lives and care about the people in it. You should use our store because our family cares more about our clients than big name chain pet shops do, and we will do everything we can to help you and your furry friends out!
